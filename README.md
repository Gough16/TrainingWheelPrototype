# TrainingWheelPrototype
## Software Specifications Prototype

This program is software for a immunization tracker.
I am programming this as my prototype for my software specifications project in my junior year at Florida Gulf Coast University

## Documentation 

For this project I elicited stakeholder requirements and used them to make a mock up and then I developed the prototype. 
Developing this prototype allows for the client (TrainingWheel) to get a better feel of what a clickable version of the product
might look like and allows them to express any concerns that they have with initial designs before the product is complete. 

## Getting Started -> Software needed

In order to get this project running, on your local computer for demonstration/testing, 
you must have Intellij (IDE) installed on your computer. 
Once you have that installed, you will get the link to this repository and pull it to you
intellij program to get it running.

## History

## Key Programming Concepts Utilized

In this program, I utilized the concepts that I learned in Java in previous courses.
I've used scene builder to help me build my program environment, and a css file to create a custom 
look to the environment. I used the material from professor Vanselow, Swebok, and IEEE to elicit requirements 
and build a prototype for the stakeholders to review.
